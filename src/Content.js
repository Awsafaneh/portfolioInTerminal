    "sectionContent" : `I'm a computer science student for at least one year and a programmer self-student for at least two. I like to think about how to describe real problems using programming and how to write elegant code.

Moreover, I like to study programmer languages, functional programming, clean code, and talk about Linux, open-source, and tech in general. 

Thanks for reading, feels free to send me a message ðŸ¤—
